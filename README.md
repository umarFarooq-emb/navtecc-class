# NAVTECC-CLASS

This Repository contains all the work we do in the class, and a starting point for the students to start programming.

We have worked on the basics of `C programming` and also on arduino. Now, we have started working on `stm32`.

This repository has the following branches.

- c-programming-getting-started
- arduino-getting-started
- stm32-getting-started

Please move to each branch and download/clone the code, and get along with it.
